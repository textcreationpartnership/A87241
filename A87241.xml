            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161184:3"/>of our hor≈øemen being plundering neer the Town, was by ≈øome of the Rebels wounded, and carried a pri≈øoner into the Ca≈øtle, from whence he was admitted to ≈øend for a Chirurgeon into our Quarters to dre≈ø≈øe his wounds, of which we made this u≈øe; One Colonel <hi>James Heppe≈øly,</hi> who had formerly ≈øerved the King, and was (upon ≈øome a≈ø≈øurance given me by a friend, of his doing ≈øervice) admitted to come into our Quarters, being an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per≈øon skilled in Chirurgery, and in Fortifications, took upon him to go under a di≈øgui≈øe into the Ca≈øtle, and to dre≈ø≈øe the wounded Trooper; which accordingly he did with ≈øo great caution and circum≈øpection, as that he di≈øcovered perfectly the condition of the Ca≈øtle in each re≈øpect, the weakne≈ø≈øe of the Ward, and e≈øpecially ≈øome defects in the wall of the outward Bawne, which rendered it a≈ø≈øiultable by our men, the taking whereof would probably induce the ≈øurrender of the Ca≈øtle, which he collected from the ob≈øerved timorou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which ≈øorted to ≈øo good purpo≈øe, as that falling on the place defective with a party led on by Colonel <hi>Heppe≈øly</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, wee carried that outward Bawne, and ≈øome out-Turrets by ≈øtorm, and within a few hours after had the Ca≈øtle ≈øurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto us on quarter onely for life, though upon entry of it wee found that the ≈øame was by no force of ours to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, if the defendants had not been by divine providence depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of any courage to oppo≈øe us.</p>
            <p>The place is ju≈øtly looked upon by this Armie as the mo≈øt important in the whole Province, being of that ≈øtrength as not to be taken from us ≈øo long as we have victuall to ≈øupport a Gari≈øon therein, whereby a pa≈ø≈øe is kept open for us to make daily incur≈øions into this Country, which hath been a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall contributary to the Rebels Army.</p>
            <p>To the performance of which Service the Souldier was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with no other food then the roots under, and corn above the ground (all their cattell being driven away before us out of our reach) of the later whereof wee had great and abundant ≈øtore, ≈øo as we have burned in this County above 20000 pounds worth, whereof there could be no u≈øe-made through want of hand-mils, (for which I have often and earne≈øtly written) the water-mils being for the mo≈øt part either burned or de≈øerted.</p>

My Lord hath placed in Gari≈øon the Regiment of Colonel <hi>Francis Roe,</hi> which was ≈øent over by the Parliament with the Lord <hi>Li≈øle,</hi> at <hi>Cahir.</hi> From hence my Lord commanded us to march im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the City of <hi>Ca≈øhel,</hi> ≈øix large miles di≈øtant, where the ≈øupreme Councel of the Rebels lately held their meetings; and found that the ≈øudden and unexpected taking of <hi>Gahir</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, and the burning of the Country, had ≈øo affrighted the ≈øoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and inhabitants, that the ≈øouldiers had quitted the City, left open the gates, and were gotten into the Cathedral Church ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on a high Rock next the City, which they had fortified for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161184:5"/>in all, ≈øix entire Companies, and about two hundred Towns-men, and ≈øome women; who being ≈øummoned by my Lord the fir≈øt night, ≈øtood upon high terms: the next day his Lord≈øhip offered them to march with their Arms, which they refu≈øed, but afterwards would have accepted of it; but my Lord having drawn out the men ready, and conceiving the work to fea≈øible, commanded the men to fall on, which they did re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and bravely, and in little more then an hours time the Church was taken, and all the men put to the ≈øword, except the Governour (Lieutenant. Col. <hi>Butler</hi>) who is dangerou≈øly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Major <hi>Butler,</hi> who was Maior of the Town, his ≈øon, and ≈øome few others who were taken pri≈øoners. Tho≈øe ≈ølain were above four hundred: and ≈øuch was the goodne≈ø≈øe of God to us, that we lo≈øt but one Captain and eight men in this ≈øervice; but indeed we have neer an hundred hurt. The Rebels are in a cruel fright, whereof my Lord intends to make the be≈øt u≈øe he can, and is now ≈øending to ≈øummon <hi>Fitherd,</hi> a ≈øtrong walled Town five or ≈øix miles hence, and within fourteen miles of the City of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi> which hath been the ne≈øt and magazine of the chiefe≈øt of the Rebels. Ble≈ø≈øed be the Lord for this good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe on this noble Lord and this Army, who are very entire, and very ready to do as much as men in their ca≈øe can do for the ≈øervice of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>I thought good hereby to give you notice of what hath pa≈øt ≈øince my Lord made his di≈øpatch, being now three days ago, and withal to let you know that we have now received notice that the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> with about five thou≈øand Rebels (who dare not give us battel) have done us ≈øome mi≈øchief about <hi>Cork</hi> in our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, in burning the hou≈øes and corn about <hi>Garrigroghan,</hi> from whence they went to <hi>Awneboy.</hi> ≈øix miles we≈øtward, and burnt al≈øo there, and got ≈øome money to ≈øpare other parts; and now they lie about <hi>Bandon,</hi> and threaten it. What my Lord and the Councel will do hereupon, is not yet known to us; but without doubt they will do what they conceive be≈øt for the Service, as far forth as God ≈øhall enable them: And if we be ≈øo happie as to overtake them, I tru≈øt I ≈øhall ≈øend you a further Relation by the next, which you will have cau≈øe to ble≈ø≈øe God for. And ≈øo I re≈øt,</p>
